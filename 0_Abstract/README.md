A Light-Emitting diode(LED) is a semiconductor light source.LEDs are used as indicator lamps in many devices and are increasingly used for other lighting.
The entire circuit of LED running light is designed using two general purpose NPN transistors. The design and working of this circuit are very simple and straightforward. Both of these transistors are configured in astable multivibrator mode.
